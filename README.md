[Open Metaverse Interoperability](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup) - bridges virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more.<br>
[Dat](https://dat-ecosystem.org/) - peer-to-peer protocol <br>
[IPFS](https://ipfs.io) - peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol<br>
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/learn/) - Decentralized world computer<br>
